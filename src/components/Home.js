              I am an aspiring developer focused on doing things the right way the first time. I am a quick learner and
              will not rest until I have accomplished our goals. I have repeatedly demonstrated the ability to fix
              hardware and software problems. Iâ€™m  very pro-active and willing to take the lead. I thrive in a group
              environment always looking for the best outcome for the team. I crave learning new skills, and look
              forward to helping contribute to your team.
